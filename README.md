> Super simple Subtitle player: Search & Play!
> 
> #### SEARCH
> - Search movies and TV series through the huge OpenSubtitles.org online database
> - Find the subtitles in your preferred language (OpenSubtitles.org offers 70+ languages)
> - Binge watching? Tired to write? Get to the next episode and even the next season quickly with E+1 and S+1 buttons.
> 
> #### PLAY!
> - The subtitle file starts playing right after you choose it in the list
> - Play/Pause button if you need a break
> - Use the scrub bar to find your favorite scene
> - Delay or advance in time, so you stay synced with your video
> - Share subtitles to any other app
> - Swipe up to go fullscreen and scrub easily
> 
> #### TIPS
> - Perfect if you do not want to see the subtitles spoiling the screen on top of your movie/TV series!
> - This is also useful to perfect your English (or any foreign language depending on the original version), since you focus on the voices more than reading every word, especially if the subtitles are translated. Put your iOS device somewhere near, you'll get used to check the subtitles only when you'd be lost!
> 
> Completely free and unlimited, with ads that can be easily removed.<br>
